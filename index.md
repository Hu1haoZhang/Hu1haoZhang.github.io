Welcome! I'm Huihao Zhang
This site includes some of my daily life content, as well as research.

My research focuses on exoplanet observations (more specifically, observations of exoplanet atmospheres), which includes direct imaging by Keck-HISPEC and ELT(E-ELT/HARMONI, E-ELT/METIS, TMT/MODHIS) and Transit photometry by JWST/NIRSpec
