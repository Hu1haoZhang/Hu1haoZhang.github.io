# About Me

<!--author-->

I was born in [Jining](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jining), which is roughly the midpoint between Beijing and Shanghai. Before coming to Ohio State University, I never expected to leave china, nor had I ever left china. It was in 2020 that I received my first passport.

## Education
I started my bachelor's degree in safety engineering at Shandong Jiaotong University located in [Jinan]() in 2018. In 2020, I transferred to Ohio State University in the United States to pursue a Bachelor's degree in Physics with Astronomy.

## Hobbies

I really enjoy aerobic exercise. Specifically, I enjoy road cycling with long distance running (although my knees no longer support me in this sport). If you are a fan of Team Jumbo-Visma, then we'll definitely be good friends.

Other than that, I also play some video games. I've been playing Dark Souls 3 a lot lately as well as Elden Ring, and there's no doubt that I'm a fan of Hidetaka Miyazaki. In the Chinese community, we usually call him "Mean Miyazaki(宫崎老贼)".

I am also a member of the Launchpad Astronomy translation team on the youtuber channel. My main job is to translate the videos that are allowed to be translated into Chinese and post them on the Chinese community [Bili Bili](https://space.bilibili.com/1679558358?spm_id_from=333.337.0.0).
