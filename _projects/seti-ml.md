This is the final project of the [Physics 5680](https://ascnet.osu.edu/storage/request_documents/4675/Physics%205680%20New%20Course.pdf) at The Ohio State University, under the supervision of Dr. [Richard Hughes](https://www.asc.ohio-state.edu/hughes.319//hughes.html?_gl=1*n94390*_ga*MTUwNDEyMzQ4NS4xNjYxMjk1MzU5*_ga_09WC99HMPE*MTY3MzIzOTE1NC44MC4xLjE2NzMyNDAyMjMuNjAuMC4w).

This project is based on the Kaggle project:[Spaceship Titanic](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/spaceship-titanic) and uses several methods to explore the role of machine learning in data.

Specifically, the machine learning techniques used in this project are:

For Processing Data: *[Correlation Matrix](https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/excel/correlation-matrix/)*, *[Graph Analysis](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/glossary/data-science/graph-analytics/#:~:text=Graph%20analytics%2C%20or%20Graph%20algorithms,the%20graph%20as%20a%20whole.)*, *[Label Encoder](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.LabelEncoder.html)*, *[Min-max normalization](https://www.codecademy.com/article/normalization)*

For Training Models: *[LinearSVC](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.svm.LinearSVC.html)*, *[Decision Tree](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/tree.html)*, *[Random Forest](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.ensemble.RandomForestClassifier.html)*, *[FCN](https://towardsdatascience.com/review-fcn-semantic-segmentation-eb8c9b50d2d1)*, *[1D CNN](https://machinelearningmastery.com/cnn-models-for-human-activity-recognition-time-series-classification/)*

The main language used in this project is python. the libraries used are [sklearn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/)(LinearSVC, Decision Tree, Random Forest) and [Keras](https://keras.io/)(FCN, 1D CNN)
