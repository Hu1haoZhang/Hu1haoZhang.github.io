We use the [BT-Settl](http://astro.vaporia.com/start/btsettl.html) model to simulate the flux of TRAPPIST-1, assuming that TRAPPIST-1~e has an Earth-like albedo(Modern), and use the [method](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-3881/aa6474) proposed by Dr. [Wang Ji](https://www.jiwang.io/) and Dr. [Mawet Dimitri](https://pma.caltech.edu/people/dimitri-mawet) et al. to simulate the results of ELT direct imaging of TRAPPIST-1~e.
