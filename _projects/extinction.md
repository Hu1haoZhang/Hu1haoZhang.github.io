Based on [NASA](https://exoplanetarchive.ipac.caltech.edu/overview/trappist-1e) publicly available data, we assume that TRAPPIST-1~e has the atmosphere of Modern Earth and Archean Earth.

We use [PICASO](https://natashabatalha.github.io/picaso/) and [petitRADTRANS](https://petitradtrans.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for simulating the transmission spectra of TRAPPIST-1~e and use PandExo for simulating JWST observation results of TRAPPIST-1~e

Based on the [method](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ac29be) proposed by [Phillips Caprice](https://capricephillips.github.io) and Dr. [Wang Ji](https://www.jiwang.io) to quantify the ability of JWST and ELT to detect a single gas biosignature in the atmosphere of exoplanets, we proposed a method to detect the ability of JWST and ELT to detect a gas pair biosignatures.

The main language of the project is Python, and the main libraries used in this project are PICASO, PandExo, petitRADTRANS, Astropy, NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib.

This project was selected by [Undergraduate Research Apprenticeship Program(URAP)](https://ugresearch.osu.edu/current-researchers/funding-opportunities/undergraduate-research-apprenticeship-program-urap) of Ohio State University and was awarded a three-month(May - July, 2022) research fellowship for a total of \$6,000(Approx)
