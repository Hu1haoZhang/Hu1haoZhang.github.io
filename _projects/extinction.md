Based on [NASA](https://exoplanetarchive.ipac.caltech.edu/overview/trappist-1e) publicly available data, we assume that TRAPPIST-1~e has the atmosphere of Modern Earth and Archean Earth.

We use [PICASO](https://natashabatalha.github.io/picaso/) and [petitRADTRANS](https://petitradtrans.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for simulating the transmission spectra of TRAPPIST-1 e and use PandExo for simulating JWST observation results of TRAPPIST-1~e

Based on the [method](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ac29be) proposed by [Caprice Phillips](https://capricephillips.github.io) and Dr. [Ji Wang](https://www.jiwang.io) to quantify the ability of JWST and ELT to detect a single gas biosignature in the atmosphere of exoplanets, we proposed a method to detect the ability of JWST and ELT to detect a gas pair biosignatures.

We use the [BT-Settl](http://astro.vaporia.com/start/btsettl.html) model to simulate the flux of TRAPPIST-1, assuming that TRAPPIST-1 e has an Earth-like albedo(Modern), and use the [method](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-3881/aa6474) proposed by Dr. [Ji Wang](https://www.jiwang.io/) and Dr. [Dimitri Mawet](https://pma.caltech.edu/people/dimitri-mawet) et al. to simulate the results of ELT direct imaging of TRAPPIST-1~e.

The main language of the project is Python, and the main libraries used in this project are PICASO, PandExo, petitRADTRANS, Astropy, NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib.

This project was selected by [Undergraduate Research Apprenticeship Program(URAP)](https://ugresearch.osu.edu/current-researchers/funding-opportunities/undergraduate-research-apprenticeship-program-urap) of Ohio State University and was awarded a three-month(May - July, 2022) research fellowship for a total of \$6,000(Approx)
